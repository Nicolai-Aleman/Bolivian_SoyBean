Linear regression and VAR analysis to justify the selection of soybeans as a backing commodity in foreign debt tokenization through futures contracts and P2P transactions.
# 🌱📈 Soybean Analysis for Debt Tokenization

## 📝Project Description
Welcome to this repository, which contains the full analysis to justify the selection of soybeans as a backing commodity in my thesis on tokenization of foreign debt through P2P transactions and futures contracts. I use multivariate linear regression and a VAR model to show that soybeans offer stability and a strong correlation with exports, outperforming other commodities such as zinc, silver, gold and natural gas.
## 🎯 Objectives of the Analysis.  
✅ **Justification of Choice:** Demonstrate with empirical and theoretical evidence why soybeans are the best commodity.  
✅ **Market Assessment:** Analyze the historical evolution, volatility and liquidity of soybeans.
